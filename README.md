This parsing algorithm allows you to parse so called "cryptocurrency signals". These signals are commonly found in telegram groups and are formatted based on their source. However, it would be way more organized if all these signals would share the same format. Well, that's exactly what this program does.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Parse symbols / (entry, target, stop loss)
- [ ] Write more in depth documentation.
- [ ] Add Telegram / discord integration
- [ ] Add front-end for ease of use.
- [ ] Add Binance integration for automated trading.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/JuicedBakker/crypto-signal-parser/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## The goal of this project

I'm aiming towards making an app which is used by the client, which everyone can use to automatically open trades that are posted in telegram groups. So even if you're busy that day, you can still follow the trades posted in the channels you follow. I believe this would enable people to trade more efficiently and allow them to not be on their phone, worrying about missing anything.
